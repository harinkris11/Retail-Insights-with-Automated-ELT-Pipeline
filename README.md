# Retail-Insights-with-Automated-ELT-Pipeline

Project Workflow

The Retail Data Analysis Project follows a structured workflow to ensure a comprehensive analysis and modeling process. The steps are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning

Objective: Prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

Steps:

Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.

Handle missing values by imputing or removing incomplete entries.

Standardize data types for accurate computations.

Correct or remove outliers that may skew analysis results.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: Understand the dataset and extract key insights.

Steps:

Analyze sales trends over time to identify seasonality or patterns.

Examine top-selling products and most valuable customers.

Conduct country-wise analysis to identify regions with the highest sales.

Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to uncover correlations and distributions.

3. Feature Engineering

Objective: Enhance the dataset with new features to improve analysis and modeling.

Steps:

Create derived metrics such as TotalPrice (calculated as Quantity Ã— UnitPrice).

Generate time-based features like Month, Day, or Weekday for temporal analysis.

Develop customer segmentation features (e.g., total spending, purchase frequency).

4. Data Modeling

Objective: Build and evaluate models to generate actionable insights and predictions.

Steps:

Train regression models for sales forecasting.

Use clustering algorithms for customer segmentation.

Evaluate models using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, or silhouette score.

5. Data Validation and Quality Checks

Objective: Ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and reliable for analysis.

Steps:

Validate cleaned and processed data using Soda.

Perform sanity checks on derived features and metrics.

6. Pipeline Orchestration

Objective: Automate and streamline the data processing and analysis workflow.

Steps:

Use Apache Airflow for task scheduling and pipeline automation.

Containerize the application using Docker to ensure consistent environments.

7. Insights and Visualization

Objective: Present findings in a clear and actionable manner.

Steps:

Generate visualizations for sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

Create interactive dashboards using Tableau or Matplotlib.

8. Deployment and Reporting

Objective: Deliver the final product and insights to stakeholders.

Steps:

Deploy predictive models to a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud).

Compile results and insights into reports for presentation.
